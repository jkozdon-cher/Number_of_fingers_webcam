# Number_of_fingers_webcam

## General info
This project shows how we can count the number of fingers shown on a hand.
This script was created due to the desire to learn the Open CV library and can be used as a base for expansion with new functionalities, 
for example, to control a drone or other vehicle whose camera is looking at us.

## Technologies
* Python 3.9
* Open CV 4.6

## Setup
To run a project, all you need to do is have Python installed with the Open CV library and any webcam available.
After running the script, a window with the webcam image is displayed. 
Place your hand in the marked square, and above you will see an inscription indicating how many fingers you are showing on your hand.
